**Discriminative models**, also referred to as **conditional models**, are a class of logistical models used for [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification "Statistical classification") or regression. They distinguish decision boundaries through observed data, such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.

Typical discriminative models include [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression "Logistic regression") (LR), [conditional random fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field "Conditional random field") (CRFs) (specified over an undirected graph), [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_trees "Decision trees"), and many others.
