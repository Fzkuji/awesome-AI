# Paper Outline: Model Merging for Knowledge Editing

## Introduction

1. **Background & Research Significance**
	- Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized NLP by capturing vast amounts of world knowledge and exhibiting impressive generalization capabilities
	- As environments rapidly change, LLMs inevitably face challenges with their factual knowledge becoming outdated or requiring timely corrections
	- Knowledge editing is crucial for maintaining model accuracy, especially as world information evolves
2. **Research Problem & Challenges**
	- Knowledge editing refers to the task of efficiently updating or correcting specific knowledge in pre-trained language models
	- The key challenge lies in updating targeted knowledge without degrading the model's general capabilities or requiring complex architectural modifications
	- Balancing knowledge preservation with editing effectiveness remains difficult
3. **Current Research Status & Limitations**
	- Existing knowledge editing approaches can be categorized into three main paradigms: memory-based methods, meta-learning approaches, and locate-then-edit methods
	- These methods face significant limitations:
		- Many require additional model structures or architectural modifications
		- After knowledge editing, models often experience degradation in general capabilities in sequential editing scenarios
4. **Our Proposed Solution**
	- We propose a simple yet effective framework combining fine-tuning with model merging for knowledge editing
	- Our method first employs Robust Supervised Fine-Tuning (R-SFT) on the model's Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) to learn new knowledge
	- Then merges the fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model to preserve both updated knowledge and general capabilities
	- This approach avoids architectural modifications while maintaining balance between knowledge preservation and editing effectiveness

5. **Contributions**
	- First to apply model merging techniques to knowledge editing, providing a simple yet effective solution without architectural modifications
	- Propose a two-stage approach that first fine-tunes the model to learn new knowledge, then merges the fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model
	- Experimental results show our method outperforms existing approaches in sequential editing while better maintaining the model's general performance
6. **Paper Outline**
	- Section 2 introduces our methodology, including robust supervised fine-tuning and model merging
	- Section 3 presents our experimental setup and results
	- Section 4 discusses related work in knowledge editing and model merging
	- Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses limitations

## Methodology
1. **Framework Overview**
	- Our knowledge editing framework consists of two main stages:
		- Robust Supervised Fine-Tuning (R-SFT)
		- Model Merging

2. **Robust Supervised Fine-Tuning (R-SFT)**
	- Three-loop training procedure for efficient knowledge acquisition
	- Early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting
	- Focus on accuracy, generalization, and portability of knowledge

3. **Model Merging**
	- Weighted average of original and fine-tuned models
	- Parameter pruning to reduce interference
	- Scaling parameter to control preservation-editing trade-off
