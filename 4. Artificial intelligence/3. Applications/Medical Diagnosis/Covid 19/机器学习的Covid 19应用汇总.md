### Before Infection

#### Identify Symptoms

It is found that China has developed AI-driven sensors that can quickly recognise individuals with a fever, even in crowds. The sensing of COVID-19 patients can be detected by using AI-based technology in Florida through **facial thermal** scans (V. Kumar, 2020). 

AI-based an app, ‘COVID voice detector’ used to detect the infection in the **human voice**. Augmented reality and virtual reality technology provided the virtual environment to the patients to engage with medical professionals.

Machine learning-based artificial intelligence model is used (Imran et al., 2020) to develop an app named 'AI4COVID-19' to preliminary diagnosis the COVID-19 patients, by taking their **two seconds cough recordings**. 

Various mechanisms can be used to detect the COVID-19 in human beings, such as **CT and X-ray scan images, blood samples of the subjects**, etc. 

The primary symptoms in the COVID-19 patients are severe **fever, cold and dry cough, and tiredness**. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based smartphone sensors have been used by (Maghdid et al., 2020) to detect the above virus symptoms. 

The designed AI-enabled smartphones found the severity of pneumonia and could also predict the result of the disease. Machine learning-based, an urgent end-to-end data-driven modelling approach was proposed to gather the health care data input to a Supervised Machine learning model to ascertain an individual's health status (Anthony, 2020). The proposed approach used an online survey questionnaire application to collect health care data

#### Infection Diagnosis

##### 通过CT诊断肺炎

纽约西奈山的研究人员[建立了一个人工智能系统](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0931-3.pdf)，该系统可以使用一种算法来帮助诊断 COVID-19 患者，该算法经过 900 多次中国患者肺部计算机断层扫描 (CT) 扫描的训练。仅根据肺部扫描诊断疾病不一定准确，因为在疾病的早期阶段扫描可能看起来正常，而由 COVID-19 引起的肺部问题可能与其他疾病相似。当然，这就是 SARS-CoV-2 抗原快速诊断测试和 PCR 测试等 COVID-19 诊断测试如此有用的原因，也是临床医生采访患者并进行身体检查以汇总一系列信息以做出诊断的原因。

Few studies have encountered changes in chest X-ray and CT images before the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms [^1].

Chest radiological imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and X-ray has played an important role in early diagnosis and treatment of the COVID19 pandemic (S. Yin et al., 2020; Zu et al., 2020).

It is found that as advised by the developed automatic models can be used to diagnose other chest-related diseases, including tuberculosis and pneumonia (Ozturk et al., 2020). However, there is a limitation of the developed model that it is **not robust** and took fewer COVID-19 X-ray images.

##### 通过咳嗽诊断感染

[麻省理工学院研究](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344930557_COVID-19_Artificial_Intelligence_Diagnosis_using_only_Cough_Recordings)人员开发的另一个人工智能系统[](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344930557_COVID-19_Artificial_Intelligence_Diagnosis_using_only_Cough_Recordings)声称能够根据某人的咳嗽声检测出 COVID-19。大流行迅速蔓延的原因之一是许多 COVID-19 患者可能没有症状。他们的感染不会引起注意，因为他们不太可能寻求检测，并且会在不知不觉中将其传染给其他人。但是麻省理工学院的团队开发了一个程序，使用来自数万次咳嗽的音频输入和来自咳嗽人群的自我报告的临床信息，试图检测有症状的 COVID-19 患者咳嗽方式与其他人咳嗽方式的差异谁没有这种疾病，即使这对医生来说听起来是一样的。如果研究人员能够证明 AI 系统擅长在具有一系列确诊病例的代表性个体样本中将 COVID-19 与其他呼吸道感染区分开来。

##### Based on Symptoms



#### Health Monitoring

Machine learning- artificial intelligence has been rolled out to monitor hospitalised patients affected by COVID-19 (McCall, 2020). 

AI has been used to monitor symptoms in the COVID-19 patients; it also provides decision support for CT and X-ray scans, and also help to automate hospital operations. Connected thermometers and bracelet-like device are used to monitor patients. 

The intelligent robots are designed in such a way that they are capable of delivering food, medicine, etc. to the patients. South Korea government developed an app allowing people to self-report symptoms of pandemic disease COVID-19 (Wittbold et al., 2020). The importance of lung imaging in tracking and treating coronavirus patients is studied by (Hunter, 2020).

#### Virtual Treatment

Various machines and deep learning methods can be used for virtual treatment or virtual reality therapy (Bălan et al., 2020; Opriş et al., 2012). It has significantly emerged in the present decades and allows the design of immersive virtual worlds that provide advancements in a safe and controlled manner (Yuan & Yang, 2019). Machine learning-guided virtual reality simulators can guide the neurosurgeons before they step into the operating room (Anderton, 2019). In the present situation, like the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, in which virus is spreading rapidly, getting more accurate scores quickly informing the problems to accelerating the development of drugs or vaccines (Schmit, 2020). Indian government using instant messaging platforms, to provide virtual health care services (Webster, 2020). Virtual robots are used to deliver medicine and food to COVID-19 patients so that the physical contact between the doctors and the patients can be avoided (V. Kumar, 2020). 

#### Prediction of future symptoms

Machine learning methods such as deep neural network and long-short term memory learning methods are used to predict the symptoms and spread of infectious diseases such as chickenpox, scarlet fever, and malaria (Chae et al., 2018). Industry 4.0 technologies are very useful in fighting against Coronavirus (Javaid et al., 2020).

Predict the symptoms of future diseases such as genetic disorders. This prediction is made by observing the facial expressions or features, predict the risk of heart attack by observing the patterns of blood vessels on the retina at the back of the eye, used to monitor a patient's posture, breathing and even sleep for early signs of illness, etc. (Kaminsky, 2019).
by collecting data from the clinical reports, doctor's notes, and various wearable body sensors (S. Wang et al., 2016).


### After Turning Negative

#### Long COVID Study

##### [Predicting Long COVID](https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/predicting-long-covid-artificial-intelligence)

Studies have shown that recovery from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can vary from person to person. Most patients seem to recover from COVID-19 quickly and completely. However, others report experiencing COVID-19 symptoms that last for weeks or months or developing new symptoms weeks after infection. These long-term effects are called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or, more commonly, [Long COVID](https://covid19.nih.gov/covid-19-topics/long-covid).

To better understand which patients develop Long COVID, the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative has launched the [NIH Long COVID Computational Challenge (L3C)](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=l3c&tab=overview). Part of the RADx-Radical program, the challenge aims to support research that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to identify COVID-19 patients with a high risk of developing Long COVID.

##### Long COVID with [myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/)

We studied brain tissue from patients who had died from COVID-19 at home. COVID-19 came on so fast, they died suddenly. They didn’t go to the hospital. They didn’t spend time in ICU. When we looked at the lungs and other organs, we saw only a little damage — not enough to cause secondary damage to the brain. We knew that damage we saw in the brain was directly related to the infection.

When we looked at the brains, to our surprise, we did not see SARS-CoV-2. Instead, we found the brains had [extensive injury to the blood vessels](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-uncovers-blood-vessel-damage-inflammation-covid-19-patients-brains-no-infection). We saw inflammatory cells — a kind of immune cell — around the blood vessels in the brain. Since these patients were functional until the time of death, we reasoned that if they had survived, they may have developed long-term neurological symptoms. It’s possible that long COVID might be similar.


## For Society

### Early days of the pandemic

#### Patient screening

It is essential to gather accurate test data using cheaper test methods, which helps screen patients suffering from the existing pandemic (Schmit, 2020).

Machine learning can help to screen COVID-19 pandemic patients by using artificial neural networks (L. Li et al., 2020).

Machine learning is also used to identify the tell-tale patterns in a patient's resting heart rate, predict drug-target interactions between the virus's proteins and existing drugs, and generate or build biomedical knowledge graphs. A deep learning algorithm using chest CT or X-ray images to screen COVID-19 patients is used (Butt et al., 2020; Ozturk et al., 2020). A deep learning and transfer learning-based model COVID-Net is used for COVID-19 detection in patients (Apostolopoulos & Mpesiana, 2020; L. Wang & Wong, 2020). A deep learning model called DarkCovidNet was proposed to detect COVID-19 (Ozturk et al., 2020).

#### Drug discovery

##### 筛选化合物

为人工智能系统提供了一个庞大的肽分子数据库，系统对其进行分析以了解分子结构与其功能或特性之间的联系。然后，他们将新分子的理想特性列表插入其中，例如特定的抗菌功能和低毒性。研究人员说，该系统现在也可以用于寻找抗 COVID-19 分子。如果进一步的实验室、动物试验和最终的人体临床试验证实了它们的有效性，这种筛选可以帮助确定最终可能对人类有用的化合物。

##### 学习重用现有药物

寻找[可以重新](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21056-z)用于治疗 COVID-19 的现有药物。由于老年人患重病和死亡的风险更高，他们假设病毒在老年人中引发的基因表达与年轻人不同，因此确定需要哪些药物来影响感染引发的特定基因和蛋白质。研究人员发现 RIPK1 蛋白是 COVID-19 药物的一个有前途的靶标，并确定了三种作用于_RIPK1_基因表达的获批药物。如果进一步测试证实这些药物对人类对抗 COVID-19 有效，则这些药物可能对对抗 COVID-19 有用。

Build Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

### COVID-19 pandemic

#### Precise and Personalised Treatment

The primary aim is to improve the diagnostic speed and accuracy of the novel coronavirus (Kesharwani et al., 2020; Suman, Nandan, Haleem, et al., 2020a, 2020b; Suman, Javaid, Nandan, et al., 2020).

The secondary aim is to identify the most susceptible people based on personalised genetic and physiological characteristics (Alimadadi et al., 2020). Personalised treatment strategies can mostly take benefit from precise classifications of the population based on categorised COVID-19 susceptibility.

The tertiary aim is to analyse personalised therapeutic effects to evaluate new COVID-19 patients. This enhancement in the hospitals will increase the better care of each patient and also improve the local hospital arrangement. It is found that with the precise treatment monitoring based on the new “liquid” detection technologies, patients can be identified quickly with increasing affordability (Faulkner et al., 2020; IJzerman et al., 2018).



### Middle and late stages of the pandemic



## 信任聊天机器人

### 聊天缓解焦虑或恐惧

AI 聊天机器人[已由](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/are-chatbots-better-humans-fighting-vaccine-hesitancy)世界各地的多个团队开发，将心理学与传染病专业知识和公共卫生知识相结合。他们还整合了文化背景和当地语言，以开发人们想要参与的系统。 

[今年法国](https://psyarxiv.com/eb2gt/)的一项研究表明，与聊天机器人互动可以显着缓解疫苗犹豫，让人们更倾向于对疫苗和接种疫苗产生积极的看法。研究人员表明，在与聊天机器人互动之前，338 名参与者中有 145 人对 COVID-19 疫苗持积极态度。在与聊天机器人交谈后，人数增加了 37%，达到 199 人。同样，在与聊天机器人互动之前，338 名参与者中有 123 人表示他们不想要 COVID-19 疫苗；在他们聊天之后，这个数字下降了 20% 至 99。
