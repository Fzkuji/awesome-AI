## Approaches

[Diffusion model](../../../../2.%20Approaches/Artificial%20neural%20network/Generative%20model/Diffusion%20model/Diffusion%20model.md)


[From Autoencoder to Beta-VAE](../../../../2.%20Approaches/Artificial%20neural%20network/Generative%20model/VAE/From%20Autoencoder%20to%20Beta-VAE.md)


[From GAN to WGAN](../../../../2.%20Approaches/Artificial%20neural%20network/Generative%20model/GAN/From%20GAN%20to%20WGAN.md)
Though originally proposed as a form of generative model for unsupervised learning, GANs have also proved useful for semi-supervised learning, fully supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
