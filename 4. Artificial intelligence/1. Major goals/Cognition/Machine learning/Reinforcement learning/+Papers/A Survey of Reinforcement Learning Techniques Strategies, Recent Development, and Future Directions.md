## [A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Techniques: Strategies, Recent Development, and Future Directions](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amit-Mondal/publication/338686816_A_Survey_of_Reinforcement_Learning_Techniques_Strategies_Recent_Development_and_Future_Directions/links/614e597e154b3227a8a8b5fc/A-Survey-of-Reinforcement-Learning-Techniques-Strategies-Recent-Development-and-Future-Directions.pdf)

### Introduction

Temporal difference learning (TD) -> entropy-based argument maximization
从早期的TD算法升级到最大熵模型？

First, we have adopted the base-line techniques from the two widely used introductory books by Sutton [^1], and Wiering [^2] about reinforcement learning. 
Baseline是两本书里的模型。
After that, we have reviewed some of the most cited published papers that utilized those baseline papers from Google Scholar from 2014 to 2018.
主要是2014到2018年的文章。

### Background

Problem Setup: Markov Decision Process (MDP) with Q-Learning.

Most of the published articles define reinforcement learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with Q-Learning.
