## GPT-3.5 says

Feature shift is a phenomenon in machine learning where the distribution of features (inputs) changes between the training and test sets. **This can happen when the data used to train a machine learning model is not representative of the data that the model will be applied to, leading to poor performance on the test set.**

For example, suppose a model is trained on images of cars taken during the day, but it is later tested on images of cars taken at night. Since the features of the images (e.g., lighting, color, etc.) are different between day and night images, the model may not perform well on the test set due to the feature shift.

To address feature shift, it is important to ensure that the training data is representative of the test data, and to use techniques such as data augmentation and domain adaptation to simulate and handle different distributions of features.
