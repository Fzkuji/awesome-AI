This framework divides the [major goals](.md) of [artificial intelligence](../Artificial%20Intelligence.md) into four key categories: [Action](Action/Action.md), [Perception](Perception/Perception.md), [Intelligence](Intelligence/Intelligence.md), and [Affection](Cognition/Affection/Affection.md). The following is a brief overview of each category:

1.  Action: This category covers the ways in which AI systems can execute actions, such as interacting with the environment or performing specific movements. Key topics in this domain include robotics, [speech synthesis](Action/Speech%20synthesis/Speech%20synthesis.md), and control systems.
2.  Perception: Focused on the ability of AI systems to acquire and process information from their surroundings, this category encompasses tasks like [computer vision](Perception/Computer%20vision/Computer%20vision.md) and [speech recognition](Perception/Speech%20recognition/Speech%20recognition.md). AI systems in this domain are designed to interpret sensory input and create a meaningful understanding of the environment.
3.  Intelligence: This category centers on the cognitive aspects of AI, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Areas of interest within this domain are [machine Learning](Cognition/Machine%20learning/Machine%20learning.md), knowledge representation, expert systems and [natural language processing](Cognition/Natural%20language%20processing.md). In AI systems, intelligence refers to the capacity to adapt, generalize, and reason based on acquired knowledge and experience.
4.  Affection: Referring to the emotional or social aspects of artificial intelligence, this category includes research fields such as affective computing, social robotics, and human-robot interaction. Additionally, it covers [affection synthesis](Cognition/Affection/Affection%20synthesis/Affection%20synthesis.md), a novel concept proposed to simulate human emotions and their associated endocrine regulation.

Although each of these categories can be further divided into more specific subfields, and some areas may overlap between categories, this four-category framework offers a valuable structure for comprehending the diverse aspects of artificial intelligence.
