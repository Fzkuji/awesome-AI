With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in intelligent customer service, content generation, and code assistance, inference efficiency has become a critical factor affecting their industrial deployment. The response latency issue is particularly prominent - each token generation requires a complete forward pass through the model, causing user waiting time to increase linearly with text length, severely impacting user experience. In scenarios demanding rapid response such as real-time dialogue, online education, and intelligent programming, excessive inference latency directly constrains technological usability. Particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and edge computing, improving inference efficiency holds significant practical value for expanding LLM application boundaries. Breaking through the efficiency bottleneck of existing architectures at the algorithmic level represents a key technical challenge in advancing LLMs from laboratory to large-scale industrial applications.

Current LLMs employ autoregressive architectures for sequential token generation. This serial mechanism fundamentally contradicts the parallel structures widely present in natural language (such as enumerated items, parallel clauses, and structured expressions). In many text generation scenarios, multiple points or paragraphs are logically independent and could theoretically be generated in parallel, yet existing models must generate each token sequentially, creating unnecessary computational redundancy and time overhead. The core problem this research addresses is how to design a novel generation paradigm that enables models to recognize inherent parallelism in text and achieve multi-token parallel generation, multiplying inference speed while maintaining generation quality.

This project explores efficient inference mechanisms based on parallel token generation. Key innovations include: (1) Constructing a novel position encoding architecture supporting multi-branch parallelism, enabling models to predict multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, theoretically achieving acceleration proportional to the number of parallel branches; (2) Designing adaptive parallelism control strategies that dynamically adjust the number of parallel-generated tokens based on contextual semantic features, balancing inference efficiency with generation coherence; (3) Validating the effectiveness of parallel mechanisms on specific generation tasks, selecting typical scenarios with inherent parallel characteristics for experimental verification and performance evaluation.

This research aims to explore new approaches for accelerating LLM inference, expecting significant efficiency improvements in task scenarios suitable for parallel generation. Through building prototype systems to validate technical feasibility, we provide new research perspectives for the academic community. Theoretical analyses and experimental results developed during the research will be organized and published, sharing exploration experiences of parallel generation techniques with peers. Looking forward, the parallel generation paradigm explored in this project represents not merely technical optimization, but a new intelligent generation modeâ€”breaking through constraints of traditional sequential thinking to explore the unique parallel processing advantages of machine intelligence. This research direction may inspire new design philosophies for future AI systems, enabling machines to demonstrate unique capabilities that transcend sequential processing limitations in certain tasks.
