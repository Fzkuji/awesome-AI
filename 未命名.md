## 2) Visual-GNSS SLAM

Visual-GNSS SLAM represents a critical fusion approach for achieving robust and globally consistent localization in challenging outdoor environments. This fusion paradigm leverages the complementary characteristics of visual odometry and global satellite navigation, where GNSS provides drift-free global positioning while visual SLAM offers high-frequency local pose estimation with rich environmental perception capabilities.

Recent advances in Visual-GNSS fusion have focused on tightly-coupled integration schemes. **GVINS** (Cao et al., 2023) presents a GNSS-Visual-Inertial system that performs factor graph optimization with raw GNSS measurements, including pseudorange and Doppler shift observations. The system demonstrates robust performance in urban canyon environments by adaptively adjusting the weight of GNSS factors based on satellite visibility and signal quality metrics. Their experimental results show centimeter-level accuracy in open-sky conditions while maintaining meter-level precision during GNSS-degraded scenarios.

**PL-GVINS** (Xie et al., 2024) extends the visual-GNSS framework by incorporating point and line features, enhancing the geometric constraints in structured environments. The system employs a sliding window optimization approach with adaptive GNSS outlier rejection based on innovation-based consistency checks. This method achieves 15% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to point-only visual-GNSS systems in urban environments.

The challenge of coordinate frame alignment and initialization has been addressed by **IC-GVINS** (Li et al., 2023), which proposes an invariant-constrained framework for Visual-GNSS-Inertial fusion. Their approach utilizes SE(3) invariant error representation to handle the nonlinear transformation between local SLAM coordinates and global GNSS frames, reducing initialization time by 40% while improving convergence stability.

**VINS-GNSS** (Zhang et al., 2024) introduces a neural-aided approach for GNSS multipath mitigation in visual-inertial-GNSS systems. By employing a lightweight CNN to predict GNSS measurement uncertainties based on visual scene understanding, the system achieves more robust fusion performance in urban canyons with 30% reduction in positioning RMSE compared to traditional χ²-test based outlier rejection methods.

For real-time applications, **Fast-GVIO** (Chen et al., 2024) presents an efficient visual-GNSS-inertial odometry system optimized for embedded platforms. The system employs a dual-thread architecture with asynchronous GNSS integration and selective keyframe-based global optimization, achieving 20Hz operation on NVIDIA Jetson platforms while maintaining sub-meter accuracy.

The emergence of multi-constellation GNSS has been leveraged by **MC-VINS** (Wang et al., 2025), which integrates GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou observations with visual-inertial SLAM. The system employs a robust M-estimator with constellation-specific weighting to handle inter-system biases and clock differences, demonstrating 25% improvement in satellite availability in urban environments.

**GraphGVIO** (Liu et al., 2024) reformulates the Visual-GNSS problem as a pose graph optimization with semantic constraints. By incorporating semantic segmentation to identify and weight stable visual features, the system reduces the impact of dynamic objects on both visual tracking and GNSS-visual alignment, achieving robust performance in highly dynamic urban scenarios.

Recent work has also explored learning-based approaches for Visual-GNSS fusion. **DeepVG-SLAM** (Park et al., 2024) employs a transformer-based architecture to learn optimal fusion weights based on visual scene context and GNSS signal characteristics. The learned fusion policy demonstrates superior adaptability to varying environmental conditions compared to fixed-weight schemes.

Despite these advances, several challenges remain in Visual-GNSS SLAM: (1) the handling of GNSS signal intermittency in urban canyons and indoor-outdoor transitions; (2) optimal fusion strategies for RTK/PPP corrections with visual constraints; (3) efficient map management for large-scale operations; and (4) robustness to visual degradation in adverse weather conditions while maintaining GNSS integration integrity. These challenges are particularly critical for ASV applications where the maritime environment presents unique difficulties including water reflections affecting both visual features and GNSS multipath propagation.
