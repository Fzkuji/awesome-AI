- $p \leftrightarrow q$  is read "$p$ if and only if $q$," and called a **biconditional**.
	- If $p$ is necessary and sufficient for $q$, then $p \leftrightarrow q$.
	- $p \leftrightarrow q$ is logically equivalent to $(p \to q) \wedge (q \to p)$ (If and only if).
	- "If and only if" is often abbreviated `iff`.
