本想对整个数学领域有一个宏观的概念，奈何分支众多，只好暂时按照美国数学会的详细分类进行学习，有朝一日再做整理。

I originally wanted to have a macroscopic concept of the entire field of mathematics, but there are too many branches, so I have to study according to the detailed classification of the American Mathematical Society for the time being. Maybe one day I will organize it again.
