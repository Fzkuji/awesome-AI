## Areas of mathematics

![Mathematistan](../Resources/2.%20Mathematics/Mathematistan.jpg)

The field of mathematics can be subdivided into several categories based on their focus, methods, and applications. Here's a possible way to divide the field:

1.  Pure Mathematics: Pure mathematics focuses on the development of abstract mathematical theories, concepts, and structures without a specific application in mind. Subfields within pure mathematics include:

	- **Algebra**: Studies abstract algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields. 
	- **Analysis**: Deals with concepts like limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration. It includes real analysis, complex analysis, and functional analysis. 
	- **Geometry**: Investigates the properties of shapes and their relationships in space. This includes Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and differential geometry.
	- **Topology**: Studies the properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous transformations. This includes general topology, algebraic topology, and differential topology.
	- **Number Theory**: Explores the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers and prime numbers.
	- **Combinatorics**: Examines the arrangement, selection, and counting of objects in discrete structures.
	- **Set Theory and Logic**: Investigates the foundations of mathematics, including axiomatic systems, mathematical logic, and the study of infinite sets.

2.  Applied Mathematics: Applied mathematics deals with the development and application of mathematical methods to solve problems in various disciplines. Subfields within applied mathematics include:

	- **Mathematical Modeling**: Constructs mathematical representations of real-world systems and phenomena.
	- **Differential Equations**: Studies equations involving derivatives, with applications in many scientific fields.
	- **Optimization**: Develops techniques to find the best solution to a problem with given constraints.
	- **Probability and Statistics**: Focuses on the analysis, interpretation, and prediction of random phenomena and data.
	- **Mathematical Physics**: Applies mathematical techniques to solve problems in physics, such as quantum mechanics and general relativity.
	- **Biomathematics**: Uses mathematical methods to study biological systems, such as population dynamics, neural networks, and genetics.
	- **Financial Mathematics**: Develops mathematical tools for pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization in finance.

3.  Computational Mathematics: Computational mathematics focuses on the development, analysis, and implementation of numerical algorithms and computational techniques for solving mathematical problems. Subfields within computational mathematics include:

	- **Numerical Analysis**: Develops and analyzes algorithms for approximating solutions to mathematical problems.
	- **Computational Geometry**: Studies algorithms for solving geometric problems.
	- **Computational Optimization**: Develops efficient algorithms for solving optimization problems.
	- **Scientific Computing**: Applies computational methods to model and simulate complex systems in various scientific disciplines.
	- **Cryptography**: Designs and analyzes algorithms for secure communication and data protection.
	- **Computational Algebra**: Studies algorithms for solving problems in algebra, such as polynomial factorization and linear algebra.
	- **Computer Algebra Systems**: Develops software for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions.


This subdivision is not exhaustive, and there is often considerable overlap between these categories. Additionally, new subfields and interdisciplinary areas continue to emerge as mathematics evolves and finds new applications in various domains.
