Probabilistic graphical model

Let's first understand what each of these words mean in the context of this framework: 

The model (模型) is a **declarative** representation of our understanding of the world.

Declarative means it stands on its own. 

I think a model is like a class in programming. 
- a model/class make sense of it aside from any algorithm/implementation
- a model/class can have multiple algorithms/implementations

Besides, an algorithm can be constructed from a model by **domain experts** or **learning from data**.
