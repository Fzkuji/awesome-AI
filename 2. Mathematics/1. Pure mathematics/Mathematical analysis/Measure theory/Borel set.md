# Borel set

## Personal explanation

首先举个例子：

假如我们现在研究实数，我们就有从负无穷到正无穷——$-\infty , + \infty$的一条实数线$\mathbb{R}$。于是在这条线上，任何我们可以写出来范围的集合都是Borel set，比如$(0,1]$、$(1,2)$，亦或是$(0,1) \cup  [1,1]$。所以这些集合也叫好集。



## Wikipedia

In mathematics, a Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative complement. Borel sets are named after Émile Borel.

For a topological space $X$, the collection of all Borel sets on $X$ forms a $\sigma$-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel $\sigma$-algebra. The Borel algebra on $X$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in measure theory, since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a Borel measure. Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy also play a fundamental role in descriptive set theory.

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the compact sets of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many well-behaved spaces, including all Hausdorff $\sigma$-compact spaces, but can be different in more pathological spaces.

根据维基百科，Borel集是在拓扑空间中可以通过开集（或等价地，通过闭集）通过可数并集、可数交集和相对补集操作形成的任何集合。

然后，所有在拓扑空间X上的Borel集组成了σ-代数，也被称为Borel代数或Borel σ-代数。在测度论中，Borel集很重要，因为在空间的开集或闭集上定义的任何测度也必须在该空间的所有Borel集上定义。在某些情况下，Borel集被定义为由拓扑空间的紧集生成，而不是开集​。
