# Proof by exhaustion
In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into a finite number of cases and proving each one separately. The number of cases sometimes can become very large.

Proof by exhaustion也就是穷举法，然而这里的穷举并不是严格的所有样本都去验证，而是只要存在需要分类讨论的情况，就算是一种穷举。

如果分了两种情况讨论，每种情况也可以分别用[Direct proof](2.%20Mathematics/0.%20Foundations%20of%20mathematics/Mathematical%20proof/Methods%20of%20proof/Direct%20proof/Direct%20proof.md)，但是整体上还是[Proof by exhaustion](2.%20Mathematics/0.%20Foundations%20of%20mathematics/Mathematical%20proof/Methods%20of%20proof/Proof%20by%20exhaustion/Proof%20by%20exhaustion.md)。
