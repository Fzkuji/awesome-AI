# Proof by exhaustion
In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into a finite number of cases and proving each one separately. The number of cases sometimes can become very large.

Proof by exhaustion也就是穷举法，然而这里的穷举并不是严格的所有样本都去验证，而是只要存在需要分类讨论的情况，就算是一种穷举。

如果分了两种情况讨论，每种情况也可以分别用[[Direct proof]]，但是整体上还是[[Proof by exhaustion]]。
