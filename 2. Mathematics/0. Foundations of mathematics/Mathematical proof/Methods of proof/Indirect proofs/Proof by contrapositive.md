# Proof by contrapositive

非数理逻辑中的对位证明法的简要概念可以看这里：[Proof by contrapositive](../../../../../Attachments/2.%20Mathematics/0.%20Foundations%20of%20mathematics/Mathematical%20proof/Mathematical%20proof/IMG-20240212100314598.pdf)

To prove the statement "If P is true, then Q is true.", you could choose to instead prove the equivalent statement "If Q is false, then P is false." (if that seems easier).

This is called a proof by contrapositive.
