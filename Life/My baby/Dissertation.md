The oceans are the largest ecosystem on Earth and are rich in resources. The future of the oceans is highly competitive and unmanned boats will play a key role in it.海洋竞争很大 无人艇关键
In many industries, especially in transportation and logistics, there is a rapidly growing demand for automation technologies to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This also involves the automatic docking or parking issues of unmanned vehicles, drones, and unmanned ships
Compared to monocular vision, binocular vision provides spatial depth information, which is crucial for accurate distance estimation and three-dimensional scene reconstruction.
Three-dimensional reconstruction techniques based on binocular vision can be used to create three-dimensional models of dock areas, which can be used for augmented reality applications or virtual training.三维重建 增强现实与虚拟训练
