# Atomic and molecular
原子和分子命题

A statement is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called molecular.
原子命题就是不能再切分的命题，分子命题就是多个原子命题。

These are statements (in fact, _atomic_ statements):
- Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.
- The moon is made of cheese.
- 42 is a perfect square.
- Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
- $\displaystyle 3+7 = 12$
And these are not statements:
- Would you like some cake?
- The sum of two squares.
- Go to your room!
- $\displaystyle 3+x = 12$
The reason the sentence “$3 + x = 12$” is not a statement is that it contains a variable.

You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using **[logical connectives](1_Philosophy/Logic/Systems%20of%20logic/Formal%20Logic/Classical%20Logic/Propositional%20calculus/Logical%20connective/Logical%20connective.md)**. 
可以用**逻辑连接词**将原子命题组合。

注：Atomic和molecular这两个形容词可以用于[sentence](1_Philosophy/Philosophy%20of%20language/Concepts/Sentence.md)、[statement](1_Philosophy/Philosophy%20of%20language/Concepts/Statement.md)、[proposition](1_Philosophy/Philosophy%20of%20language/Concepts/Proposition.md)三个概念上，都是可以的。
