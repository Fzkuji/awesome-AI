For Science!

## Introduction

âœ¨ This project is my personal study notes, which records and organizes all the machine learning knowledge I have learned with long-term updates.

ðŸ‘€ My goal is a machine with the same level of intelligence as a human. For this, I need knowledge in all aspects.

ðŸ’• This project welcomes any relevant contributions, including but not limited to personal notes, external sites, videos, and reminders of new technologies. This project will always be public. A lot of content is not written by me, but it is public content on the Internet, and references will be added if necessary. Any spread and likes are appreciated!

### AI vs. ML vs. DL by ChatGPT

[Artificial Intelligence](4.%20Artificial%20intelligence/Artificial%20Intelligence.md) (AI), [Machine learning](4.%20Artificial%20intelligence/1.%20Major%20goals/Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20learning.md) (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are interconnected concepts in the field of computer science, with each term representing a progressively narrower subdomain.

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is the broadest concept among the three, referring to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This includes problem-solving, pattern recognition, learning, planning, understanding natural language, and perception. AI can be further divided into two subcategories: narrow AI (which focuses on specific tasks) and general AI (which aims to achieve human-like intelligence across a wide range of tasks).
2. Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. ML models analyze large datasets to recognize patterns, make predictions, or generate recommendations based on the input data. There are various ML techniques, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
3. Deep Learning (DL): DL is a subset of ML that focuses on artificial neural networks, specifically deep neural networks. These networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or neurons, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning models can automatically learn complex features and representations from data, which makes them particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are examples of deep learning architectures.

In summary, AI is the broadest concept encompassing the development of intelligent machines, ML is a subset of AI that focuses on learning from data, and DL is a subset of ML that specializes in deep neural networks.

Here are some topics that are not solely focused on machine learning:

1.  Symbolic AI: Also known as classical AI or rule-based AI, symbolic AI deals with the manipulation of symbols and high-level abstractions to represent and reason about problems. Research in this area focuses on knowledge representation, inference, planning, and expert systems.
2.  Logic and Constraint Programming: This area of AI involves the use of formal logic and constraint-solving techniques to represent and solve complex problems. Research topics include propositional logic, first-order logic, constraint satisfaction problems, and answer set programming.
3.  Evolutionary Algorithms: Inspired by the process of natural selection, evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques that do not rely on gradient-based learning like many machine learning methods. Genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies are examples of research areas within this field.
4.  Swarm Intelligence: This field studies the collective behavior of decentralized and self-organized systems, such as ant colonies, bird flocking, and fish schooling. Researchers develop algorithms inspired by swarm intelligence for optimization, distributed control, and robotics.
5.  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI: Research in this area aims to improve the interaction between humans and AI systems, focusing on topics like explainable AI, interpretable AI, and human-centered AI design.
6.  AI and Ethics: This area of study examines the ethical implications of AI development and deployment, covering topics like fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, and the impact of AI on society and employment.

Please note that the mentioned research areas and topics may have evolved or expanded since September 2021, and new areas may have emerged. To find the latest studies in these areas, you can search for recent papers on academic databases like arXiv, Google Scholar, or the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology.
