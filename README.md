# Awesome AI: artificial intelligence study notes

âœ¨ Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Study Notes project! This project is my personal study notes, which records and organizes all the machine learning knowledge I have learned with long-term updates.

## Preface

> 1. Anything that is in the world when youâ€™re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
> 2. Anything thatâ€™s invented between when youâ€™re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
> 3. Anything invented after youâ€™re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

## Project Goals

ðŸ‘€ My goal is a machine with the same level of intelligence as a human. For this, I need knowledge in all aspects.

ðŸ’• I aim for my notes to be easy to understand for anyone who comes across them. I hope that anyone who searches for this content can understand my notes based on their current knowledge. Feedback and suggestions from everyone are highly encouraged.

ðŸ¤— This project welcomes any relevant contributions, including but not limited to personal notes, external sites, videos, and reminders of new technologies. This project will always be public. A lot of content is not written by me, but it is public content on the Internet, and references will be added if necessary. Any spread and likes are appreciated!

## Epilogue

> There is a limit to our life, but to knowledge there is no limit. With what is limited to pursue after what is unlimited is indeed exhausting! Those who are already chasing after knowledge are truly weary! To perform deeds considered good without craving fame, and to act in ways deemed evil without fearing punishment. Navigating the path that lies between honor and disgrace, adhering to this virtuous way of life, one can care for the body, sustain life, nurture parents, and fulfill the natural span of one's years.
