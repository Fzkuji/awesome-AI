# Awesome AI: artificial intelligence study notes

✨ Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Study Notes project! This project is my personal study notes, which records and organizes all the machine learning knowledge I have learned with long-term updates.

## Project Goals

👀 My goal is a machine with the same level of intelligence as a human. For this, I need knowledge in all aspects.

## Project Content

💕 This project welcomes any relevant contributions, including but not limited to personal notes, external sites, videos, and reminders of new technologies. This project will always be public. A lot of content is not written by me, but it is public content on the Internet, and references will be added if necessary. Any spread and likes are appreciated!
